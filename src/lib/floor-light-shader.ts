/**
 * The light that goes THROUGH the glass and lands on the photographs behind.
 *
 * Everything else in the effect layer is light ON the glass: the rim, the
 * gloss, the grime catching it. This is the other half -- what the pane does
 * to the light on its way through, painted onto whatever it is standing over.
 * The bottom of a swimming pool is the picture to hold in mind: the water is
 * clear, and yet the floor is covered in bright rippling lines, because every
 * little curve in the surface bends the light a little and the bends pile up.
 *
 * THE GEOMETRY
 *
 * Each pane stands `uGap[i]` pixels off the photograph; the light is `uHeight`
 * above it. For a point P on the photograph, the ray back to the light
 * crosses the glass at Q = P + (L - P) * gap / height. Whatever the glass is
 * doing at Q decides what reaches P:
 *
 *   Q OUTSIDE the pane -- nothing in the way. Full light.
 *
 *   Q on the BEVEL -- the rounded edge is a lens. Its outer part tips the
 *   light inward, so the floor under the very edge goes DARK, and that light
 *   piles up a little further in as a BRIGHT LINE. That is the edge of the
 *   shadow a glass of water throws: a dark rim with a bright seam inside it.
 *
 *   Q on the FACE -- mostly straight through, less a little for reflection
 *   and absorption, but the sheet is never quite flat, and its slow waviness
 *   focuses and spreads the light into the net of bright lines on the floor of
 *   a pool. It moves across the floor as the light moves, because Q does.
 *
 * The caustic comes from the glass's waviness (see causticAt), the rest from
 * the bevel's shape and the light's position.
 *
 * WHAT IT DRAWS
 *
 * Light and shadow in one pass (worked out premultiplied, written straight
 * for the shared context): white where light is added,
 * black where it is taken away. The canvas sits above the photographs and
 * below the panes, so in CSS mode the pane's own frost and bevel then bend
 * this too, exactly as they bend the photograph under it.

 * Light and shadow arriving at one point of the photograph, as the eye sees

 *
 * WHAT KIND OF GLASS
 *
 * These panes are flat sheets, frosted on the face, with a polished clear
 * bevel round the edge. That decides everything the light does:
 *
 *   The FACE is flat, so it focuses nothing. There is no pattern to throw --
 *   a pool-floor net only happens when the surface is wavy (see causticAt,
 *   off unless "Glass waviness" is raised for rolled or hammered glass). What
 *   the frost does instead is scatter: the beam going through comes out as a
 *   wider, dimmer spread of the same light, a little is sent back, and the
 *   photograph behind is seen through that same frost, so the light on it
 *   reads soft.
 *
 *   The BEVEL is clear, polished and angled: a prism. It turns the light
 *   that crosses it inward, so the floor right under it goes dark and that
 *   light lands further in as a band -- sharp-edged, brighter than the light
 *   around it because it is squeezed into less room, and fringed with colour
 *   at its edges because a prism bends blue more than red.
 *
 * All of it moves as the light moves, because where the ray crosses the
 * glass (Q) moves with the light.
 *
 * Returns the light added (per colour) in rgb and the light taken away in a.

/**
 * What the loader waits for besides files: the effects getting ready.
 *
 * Ony, 2026-10-01: "the loading page needs to load the entire application".
 * The warm-up (lib/warm-up) fetches every page's code and data and every
 * photograph; it cannot know when the glass light has its room uploaded and
 * its first frame drawn, or when the light under the glass has its textures.
 * Those were done on the first charge of the shutter, after the loader had
 * gone -- a visible hitch the first time the lamp came on.
 *
 * So an effect that has setting-up to do takes a hold while it does it and
 * lets go when it is done. The loader waits until there are no holds left.
 *
 * A hold can never keep anyone out: each one lets go by itself after
 * `maxMs`, and the loader races the whole wait against its own deadline.

 * Winding the shutter with sustained fast pointer movement.

 * Charge comes from SPEED alone, and what makes it a deliberate act is that it
 * has to be SUSTAINED: the bleed is constant, so several seconds of continuous
 * fast movement are needed before it fills, and it starts draining the moment
 * you slow down.
 *
 * That duration requirement is what keeps it from triggering by accident. A
 * single fast flick across the page lasts a fraction of a second and barely
 * registers; only someone deliberately keeping the pointer moving gets there.
 *
 * A generous locality bound remains, so that continuously travelling in one
 * direction — dragging a scrollbar, sweeping to a far corner — isn't mistaken
 * for winding. It is wide enough not to be felt while moving vigorously.

 *

 * The movement trigger measures pointer SPEED, and speed is sampled from
 * `pointermove` events, which the browser throttles to the frame rate. On a
 * page that is dropping frames -- an old machine, a heavy scroll, a tab that
 * has been backgrounded and come back -- you get a handful of samples, the
 * computed speed collapses, and winding becomes impossible at exactly the
 * moment the page is least pleasant to use. Holding is measured in elapsed
 * time instead, which does not care how many frames arrived.
 *
 * So this is not a shortcut. It is the path that still works when the other
 * one cannot, and it fills at a deliberately similar rate -- about three
 * seconds net, same as vigorous circling -- because winding a shutter should
 * feel like work whichever way you do it.
 *
 * It also happens to be what a camera does: half-press to charge, full press
 * to fire. Releasing produces a click, and the click already fires the
 * shutter when armed, so the two halves were always there.

 * How long a hold takes to fill, in milliseconds of WALL CLOCK.

 * at 3fps a 3.6 second hold reached 0.73 and never armed -- on the exact kind
 * of page this trigger exists to rescue. Measured, not reasoned about.
 *
 * Reading the clock instead makes the promise simple and keepable: hold for

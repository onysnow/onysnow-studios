/**
 * A render loop that stops when there is nothing left to draw.
 *
 * Both WebGL canvases used to re-arm unconditionally and then early-return
 * when the charge was zero, so a page nobody was touching still woke sixty
 * times a second to decide it had nothing to do. That is not just wasted
 * work: a tab with a live rAF loop never lets the browser idle its
 * compositor, so the cost is paid in battery on a page that is visually
 * static.
 *
 * `step` returns whether it still has work. False parks the loop until
 * something calls `wake`.
 *
 * The wake signal is pointer movement, and that is complete rather than
 * approximate: the charge is wound by moving the pointer and can only rise
 * from pointer motion, so nothing can light the effect up while the pointer
 * is still. Waking is idempotent and `pointermove` is throttled to the frame
 * rate anyway, so a moving cursor costs exactly what the old loop cost and a
 * still one costs nothing.

 * Files the effect layer loads, and where they actually come from.
 *
 * These used to be string literals in the components that loaded them --
 * `img.src = "/glass-surface.jpg"` in two separate files, and a hardcoded
 * array of room names inlined into a script string. Changing any of them
 * meant editing source and redeploying, which put the look of the glass
 * permanently out of reach of the person whose glass it is.
 *
 * Now each is a settings row the studio can upload to. The shipped file stays
 * as the fallback, so an empty setting is not a broken site -- it is the
 * default, which is also what "Reset to default" leaves behind.
 *
 * WHY A DATA ATTRIBUTE AND NOT A HOOK
 *
 * The consumers are WebGL initialisers inside effects that run once and then
 * own an rAF loop; they are not subscribed to anything and should not be.
 * `CustomCss` already reads the settings and writes to the document element,
 * so one more attribute costs nothing and keeps the effect layer ignorant of
 * React Query, which is the arrangement the rest of it already has.

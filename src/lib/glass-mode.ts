 * Which glass is running, and a way to change it without a reload.

 *
 *   css     backdrop-filter, an SVG displacement map per pane geometry, and
 *           the WebGL light pass. What ships.
 *   raster  ybouane/liquidglass, vendored: the page rasterised into a texture
 *           and sampled by a refraction shader, which is the only way to bend
 *           what is behind a pane rather than merely blur it.
 *
 * Comparing them is the entire point, so switching has to be instant and has
 * to survive navigation. A build flag would mean rebuilding to switch, and
 * nobody compares two things they have to rebuild between.

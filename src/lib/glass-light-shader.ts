/**
 * Fragment shader for one pane of glass.
 *
 * Built from the technique the LiquidGlass library uses, rather than from
 * guesswork: a HEIGHT FIELD over the pane, normals taken from its gradient,
 * and the backdrop SAMPLED at an offset along those normals. That last part is
 * the whole difference between refraction and a filter. A CSS filter processes
 * every pixel where it already is; refraction means fetching the backdrop from
 * somewhere else, which is why no amount of blur, brightness or tint ever
 * looked like glass here.
 *
 * The backdrop is the photograph the band is sitting on. LiquidGlass has to
 * rasterise arbitrary DOM to get a texture; this site does not, because the
 * one thing behind every pane that matters is a picture already in the page.
 *
 * Parameters carry LiquidGlass's names and its defaults as the starting point
 * — refraction 0.69, chromatic aberration 0.05, fresnel 1, edge highlight 0.05
 * — so they can be compared against the reference rather than re-invented.
 *
 * What is modelled, in the order light meets it:
 *
 *   height    the bevel. A biconvex profile, deepest at the rim, flat across
 *             the middle, which is what gives an edge its lens.
 *   normal    the gradient of that height field, from the rounded-rect SDF.
 *   refract   the backdrop sampled along the normal, per channel, because
 *             glass disperses and a real edge fringes into colour.
 *   fresnel   reflectivity climbing toward grazing angles, so the rim turns
 *             mirror-like while the centre stays a window.
 *   specular  Blinn-Phong from the cursor light, treated as a real source.
 *   arris     the lit corner, blown out by the tonemap rather than drawn.
 *   sides     the pane's thickness, opening and closing as the page scrolls.
 *   material  photographed grime, shown only where light rakes across it.

/**
 * The displacement map for the pane bevel, computed from a distance field.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED AND WHY
 *
 * The map used to be a single 8x128 PNG: a one-dimensional vertical profile,
 * green channel only, stretched across every pane with
 * `preserveAspectRatio="none"`. That carries two assumptions that are no longer
 * true. It has no horizontal component at all, so a pane narrow enough to show
 * its left and right arrises has no bend there; and its profile is a squircle
 * ramp, which is not the cross-section of a rounded-over edge.
 *
 * This computes the field instead, per pane geometry:
 *
 *   1. a rounded-rectangle signed distance function, so the bevel follows the
 *      pane's actual corner radius rather than being stretched over it;
 *   2. a circular height profile, `sqrt(d * (2R - d))` -- the true
 *      cross-section of an edge rounded over with radius R;
 *   3. the surface normal from the gradient of that height, by central
 *      differences, which is exact at every pixel and every size.
 *
 * The SDF and the height profile are from ybouane/liquidglass (MIT), which
 * arrives at the same place for a WebGL pipeline that rasterises the page into
 * a texture. We keep `backdrop-filter`, which gets the real backdrop from the
 * compositor for nothing, and take the geometry.
 *
 * ENCODING, WHICH IS FUSSY AND HAS BROKEN BEFORE
 *
 * `feDisplacementMap` reads the red channel as the X component of the
 * displacement and green as Y, each mapped from [0, 255] onto [-0.5, 0.5] and
 * then scaled. 128 is the fixed point: a pixel encoded 128 is not moved. Any
 * drift in the body of the map shifts the entire backdrop behind the pane,
 * which is what "the photographs are smeared" looked like the last time this
 * was wrong. `interiorIsNeutral` below is the guard.
 */

/*
 * The SDF, the height profile and the Snell offset used to be defined here,
 * and again -- differently -- in each shader. They live in the shared optics
 * library now, so the bend this map draws and the light the shaders draw are
 * computed from the same edge. Re-exported so existing imports keep working.

 * ---- Results, not causes (optics plan step 7) ----
 *
 * The rule Ony set: he sets CAUSES -- the light, the glass, its shape and
 * surface, where it sits, the room, the camera -- and physics sets the
 * EFFECTS. A knob for an effect lets the picture disagree with itself: turn
 * up "Fresnel" and the face reflects more than its own index of refraction
 * says it can, while every other term still uses the index.
 *
 * These are those knobs. Each is now a model constant, calibrated and
 * locked: it keeps the value it has here, it has no control in /lab, and a
 * value saved in the browser from before cannot override it. The values are
 * the ones the site already looked right with, so nothing on the page moves.
 * Where the cause that should set it does not exist yet (paper matteness,
 * lens quality), the result waits for that cause rather than keeping a
 * slider in the meantime.
 *
 * Each entry says what it follows from.

 * ---- Two sets of values, one per glass mode ----
 *
 * WHY
 *
 * Most of this panel is NOT mode-specific in the sense of being dead in one
 * mode -- the light pass, the cast shadows, the reflection and the pane's own
 * CSS surface all run whichever glass is in front of them. But they do not
 * want the SAME numbers in both. A sheen that sits right on a backdrop-filter
 * pane is wrong over a refracting one, because the two surfaces return light
 * differently; tuning one used to silently detune the other, and the only
 * symptom was coming back later to find the other mode looked worse than you
 * left it.
 *
 * So those knobs keep a value per mode. Switching the glass swaps the whole
 * set over, live.
 *
 * HOW, AND WHY IT IS DONE THIS WAY
 *
 * `knob.value` stays a single number and stays the live one. Every reader --
 * `t()` in four rAF loops, `applyTuning`, `applyGlassConfig` -- is unchanged
 * and cannot get this wrong. The inactive mode's numbers sit in `stash` and
 * are swapped in on the mode change. The alternative, making `value` a pair,
 * would have put a mode lookup inside loops that run sixty times a second and
 * would have touched every call site to save nothing.

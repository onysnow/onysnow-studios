/**
 * Fragment shader for the cursor light and its lens flare.
 *
 * Written against real optics rather than approximated with gradients, because
 * gradients cannot do the one thing that matters here. A CSS gradient
 * composites in SDR: nothing can be brighter than white, so a "blown" core has
 * to be hand-authored as a white stop and it reads as a white disc sitting in
 * an orange smear. In a renderer the core clips to white BECAUSE the intensity
 * exceeds 1.0 and the tonemap crushes everything above it — the white is an
 * outcome, not a colour choice.
 *
 * This draws the whole viewport, not a quad following the cursor. It has to:
 * a lens flare is not a property of the light, it is a property of the LENS,
 * and its ghosts march along the axis from the source through the centre of
 * the frame and out the other side. Confined to a box around the cursor there
 * is nowhere for them to go — and the box itself was visible wherever the
 * falloff crossed its edge.
 *
 * The aperture uses the N-blade signed-distance formulation: work in polar
 * coordinates, fold the angle into one blade sector, and measure distance
 * along the blade's flat edge. Mixing that distance back toward the plain
 * radius bends the blades, which is what real ones do as they open.

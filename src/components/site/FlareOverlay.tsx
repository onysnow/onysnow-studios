/**
 * The lens flare, as footage.
 *
 * Everything else the light does is computed, and for the core and the
 * diffraction spikes that is right — they have to be pin-sharp and exactly on
 * the pointer. But the parts of a flare that sell it are the parts synthesis
 * is worst at: an anamorphic streak is not a smooth gradient, it is a dirty,
 * asymmetric, faintly banded smear that breathes as the source moves, and no
 * amount of `exp()` produces that. So those come from real footage of real
 * flares, shot through real glass.
 *
 * The clips carry no alpha — they are black-background overlays, which is what
 * lens flare footage always is. `mix-blend-mode: screen` is the right
 * compositor for that and needs no alpha channel at all: screen is
 * 1-(1-a)(1-b), so black leaves the backdrop untouched while light adds. That
 * also makes alpha-WebM, which is bigger and patchily supported, unnecessary.
 *
 * The one problem with footage is that its flare is baked where the camera put
 * it, and ours has to follow the cursor. Solved the way a compositor solves
 * it: each clip is tagged with where its light source actually sits in frame,
 * and the layer is translated so that point lands on the pointer. The flare
 * then travels as a whole, which is also what a real one does — the ghosts
 * keep their spacing relative to the source because that spacing is a property
 * of the lens, not of the scene.

 * A disc of the glass itself, used as the switch between the two glasses.
 *
 * It is not an icon of glass. It is a small pane carrying the same treatment
 * the page is currently using, so pressing it changes what the button is made
 * of as well as what the site is made of. In CSS mode it is backdrop-filter
 * and a bevel drawn with an inset shadow; in raster mode the shader takes it
 * over like any other pane, because it carries `.glass` and the rasteriser
 * picks up every pane on the page.
 *
 * That is the whole reason it is a circle with no label. Two words would tell
 * you which mode you are in; a sample of the material shows you, and the
 * difference between the two systems is exactly the kind of thing you cannot
 * describe but can see side by side.

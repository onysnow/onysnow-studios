/**
 * The cursor light, rendered in WebGL.
 *
 * A canvas rather than CSS because the effect depends on light values above
 * 1.0. CSS composites in SDR — nothing can be brighter than white — so a
 * "blown out" core has to be faked as a white gradient stop, which is exactly
 * why every gradient version of this read as an orange aura with a white dot
 * in it. Here the emission genuinely exceeds the display range and a tonemap
 * clips it, so the white core, the coloured falloff and the dispersion all
 * fall out of the same calculation instead of being drawn separately.
 *
 * Viewport-sized, not a box that follows the cursor. A lens flare's ghosts
 * march along the axis from the source through the centre of the frame and
 * out the other side; penned into a box around the cursor there is nowhere
 * for them to go, and the box's own edge was visible wherever the falloff
 * crossed it.
 */

 * Bloom and flare are low-frequency; the only sharp features are the spikes
 * and the aperture rim. Held at 1.5 they stay crisp and the fill cost of a
 * full-viewport pass is less than half what a dense display would ask.

 * against the initial containing block and EXCLUDES the classic scrollbar.
 * `window.innerWidth` includes it. Sizing the drawing buffer from the wrong
 * one stretches a buffer ~17px too wide into a box that narrow, squeezing
 * everything the shader draws by about 1.3%: no error at the left edge,
 * seventeen pixels of it by the right. That is why every pane had a bright
 * line inboard of its right edge while the top and bottom sat correctly --
 * there is no horizontal scrollbar to introduce the same error vertically.

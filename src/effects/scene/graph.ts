/**
 * Stacks: panes resting on panes (light-engine architecture, step E).
 *
 * A stack is an element marked `data-stack` (written by <Stack>) whose
 * panes are its layers, in document order from the BOTTOM up: the first
 * rests on the photographs, each later one above it -- and, being later, it
 * also paints above it. What sits between two layers is the stack's
 * interface, a cause like the gap:
 *
 *   data-interface="air" data-interface-gap="12"   separate panes, 12 px apart
 *   data-interface="contact"                        resting on each other, dry
 *   data-interface="bonded"                         laminated: one pane
 *
 * From the layers and their causes this works out, for each layer, where it
 * stands (the height of its bottom face above the photographs) and what the
 * light reaching it has been through (the layers above it), using the stack
 * solver (effects/optics/stack). A pane that is not in a stack is a stack of
 * one, and everything below comes out as exactly 1 or exactly what it was,
 * so no single pane changes.

/**
 * The scene: every pane of glass and every surface resting on it, measured
 * once a frame (optics plan step 3; replaces lib/edge-glow.ts).
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, IN ORDER, EACH FRAME
 *
 *   1. commit    the lights' pending positions (effects/light/lights.ts)
 *   2. read      every rect, offset and backdrop box the frame needs -- all of
 *                them, before anything is written
 *   3. compute   the viewpoint and what each surface's shadow blocks, from the
 *                readings and the lights; no DOM at all
 *   4. write     the CSS custom properties and the side-face layers
 *
 * and passes (GlassLight, FloorLight) read the frozen snapshot of step 2
 * through glassGeometry().
 *
 * WHY THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE POINT
 *
 * Writing a style and then reading layout makes the browser resolve every
 * style on the page before it can answer. The page has 19 backdrop-filters and
 * dozens of blend modes, so each of those costs a lot. The old pass read and
 * wrote interleaved -- side-face offsets were read in the middle of each pane's
 * writes, and a lit surface's corner radius in the middle of its own -- and a
 * pointer move cost about ten style recalculations a frame. Reading
 * everything first costs one; the writes afterwards dirty style once, for the
 * next frame to resolve in its own time. e2e/scene.spec.ts holds it there.
 *
 * No React here; components register elements and the engine does the rest.

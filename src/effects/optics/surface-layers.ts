/**
 * Loading a surface layer (smudge or scratch photograph) into a WebGL context.

 * Shared by the light on the glass and the light through it, which live in
 * separate contexts, so both show the same marks from the same files.
 *
 * WebGL1 can only repeat a power-of-two texture, so an uploaded image of any
 * other size is drawn onto the nearest power-of-two canvas first -- an admin
 * upload must never be able to turn the layer black. No mipmaps: the map is
 * shown at one texel per CSS pixel, so it is never minified, and a hex-tile's
 * offset jumps between cells would pick the wrong mip level along every cell
 * border.

 *   SMUDGE_EXTINCTION  An oil film with dust in it takes about half the light
 *                      out of the direct beam where it is thick: the sharp
 *                      band and edge under a smudge go dim.
 *   SMUDGE_SCATTER     ...and scatters a part of that back in as a soft glow
 *                      rather than losing it, so under a smudge the light is
 *                      dimmer AND softer -- the halo a greasy window throws.
 *   SCRATCH_FOCUS      A scratch is a tiny groove, a cylinder lens: it gathers
 *                      the light crossing it into a thin line on what is
 *                      behind, brighter than the light around it.

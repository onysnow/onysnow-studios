/**
 * Shadows thrown onto the photographs, through the glass (item 52,
 * Ony, 2026-10-01: the shadows "dont go thru the glass like
 * theyre supposed to", and "The further away they are from the source of the
 * shadow combined with the angle, distance from the source of light and
 * brightness of that light the darker/more stretched/distorted it will be").
 *
 * Everything that stands in the light -- the copy and the buttons resting on
 * a pane, the cards, and the copy and buttons over the hero photograph -- is
 * painted, in its own shape (the very glyphs of the type), into a mask: the
 * casters. The floor light (lib/floor-light-shader), which works out the
 * lamp's light arriving at every point of the photographs, then asks of each
 * point how much of the lamp the casters hide from it. That is the whole of
 * a shadow, and everything Ony lists follows from it with nothing tuned:
 *
 *   where it falls, how big   a point P of the photograph sees the lamp
 *                             (height H, at L) along the ray to it; at a
 *                             caster's height h that ray crosses at
 *                             P + (L - P) h / H. So the shadow is the
 *                             caster's own shape, projected from the lamp:
 *                             thrown further and larger the higher the
 *                             caster stands and the nearer the lamp is.
 *   how soft, how stretched   the lamp is not a point: from P it is a disc of
 *                             radius R, and that disc, seen from P, crosses
 *                             the caster's plane as a disc of radius R h / H --
 *                             the mask is averaged over it, so the edge fades
 *                             over that width (the penumbra), growing with the
 *                             caster's height. Seen at a slant (theta off
 *                             straight down) the lamp's disc lies across the
 *                             plane stretched by 1 / cos(theta) toward it, so
 *                             a shadow far from the lamp is drawn out and
 *                             softer along the direction to the lamp.
 *   how dark                  what is hidden is the lamp's own light there --
 *                             falling as the inverse square of the distance,
 *                             with the slant, and scaled by its brightness --
 *                             so under a bright near lamp the shadow is deep
 *                             and far from it, faint; where the penumbra is
 *                             wider than the caster (a thin line of type high
 *                             up) no point is wholly hidden and the shadow is
 *                             a pale smudge.
 *   through the glass         a caster resting on a pane stands the pane's gap
 *                             and thickness higher above the photograph than
 *                             above the glass, and the frosted face spreads
 *                             the light that crosses it, so its shadow on the
 *                             photograph is further off, larger and softer
 *                             than the one on the glass -- and is seen back
 *                             through the pane's frost.
 *
 * Two heights, in two channels of the mask: red, what stands just off the
 * photograph itself (the hero's copy and buttons, CASTER_NEAR); green, what
 * rests on a pane (gap + thickness + its standoff above the glass).

/**
 * Light passing THROUGH a pane and landing on what is behind it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * The light and shadow the glass throws were drawn with one sharpness and one
 * brightness curve everywhere: a Gaussian pool with a "Light reach" setting,
 * and a single penumbra for every edge on the page. Real cast light does not
 * do that. The further the lamp is off to the side, the more obliquely its
 * light arrives, and every part of what the glass throws changes with it:
 *
 *   dimmer     irradiance falls as cos(theta) / distance^2 -- the lamp is
 *              further away AND its light is spread over more floor.
 *   less gets  glass reflects more at a slant, so less gets through: the
 *   through    transmittance (1 - F)^2 over the two faces falls off.
 *   softer     the penumbra is the lamp's size seen past the edge. A sphere
 *              seen at a slant spreads its shadow edge by 1 / cos(theta)
 *              along the direction to the lamp, so an edge facing the lamp
 *              blurs more than one running toward it.
 *   blurrier   frost scatters every ray by a small angle; the longer the slant
 *              path from glass to floor, the wider that spreads.
 *   further,   the bevel tips light by a fixed angle, and that angle carries
 *   wider      further along a slanted path (gap / cos^2 theta), so the bright
 *              band lands further from the edge and spreads wider -- the same
 *              light over more floor, so dimmer again.
 *
 * All of it is a smooth function of where the lamp is, so there is always a
 * gradient: sharp and bright under the lamp, softer and fainter away from it.
 * None of it is a setting. The causes are the lamp's position, height and
 * size, the glass's gap, index and frost.
 *
 * Each function has a GLSL twin in transmission.glsl.ts, checked in real
 * WebGL by e2e/optics.spec.ts.

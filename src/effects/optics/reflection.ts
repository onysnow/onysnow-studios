/**
 * The lamp, reflected by the face of the glass.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * The reflection used to be two settings, "Light on the glass" and "Surface
 * sheen", and both sat at 0 -- so the pane reflected nothing of the lamp at
 * all. Under the rule (you set causes, physics sets effects) neither should
 * have been a setting. How much a pane reflects is a fact about its material,
 * and how spread out that reflection is is a fact about its surface:
 *
 *   how much   ((n - 1) / (n + 1))^2 straight on -- 4.2% for float glass --
 *              rising toward grazing by Schlick's approximation.
 *   how spread the microfacet distribution (GGX) of the surface. Polished
 *              glass is nearly a mirror: a small, sharp, bright image of the
 *              lamp. Frost roughens the surface and spreads the SAME light
 *              into a wide, dim sheen. Frost never removes the reflection.
 *   how bright the lamp's irradiance at that point: its power over the
 *              square of its distance.
 *
 * The camera looks straight at the page, so the view direction is the
 * surface normal and the half-vector comes from the lamp's direction alone.
 *
 * Every function has a GLSL twin in reflection.glsl.ts, checked against this
 * one in real WebGL by e2e/optics.spec.ts.

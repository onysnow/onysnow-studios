/**
 * What a crack's fracture face shows of the room (item 10 step 3;
 * docs/broken-glass-light.md; Ony, 2026-10-01: "cracks are glass -- hard to
 * see until light hits them, not white").
 *
 * A crack is an air gap through the whole thickness, between two new glass
 * faces. Your line of sight goes into the glass, meets the face and, past
 * the critical angle (41.2 deg for n 1.518), is mirrored whole (TIR). Where
 * it goes then decides what the face shows:
 *
 * - It cannot do both: your sight inside the glass is within 41 deg of
 *   straight in, and to leave by the front it must be within 41 deg of
 *   straight out, so a mirror turning it round meets it at under 41 deg --
 *   short of total reflection. A face leaning well over (the cone's walls)
 *   sends it back out only by its partial Fresnel reflection, a few to a
 *   few tens of per cent: a dim mirror of the room behind you, bright only
 *   where that is a window or a lamp.
 * - A face near square (the radial cracks) mirrors it whole but on DOWN
 *   through the glass; it reaches the room only by the back face's 4%
 *   bounce, and otherwise shows the scene behind a little sideways: nearly
 *   invisible. Clear glass, not a white line.
 * - So a crack shines when a LIGHT lines up (effects/optics/crack-light:
 *   in at the front, mirrored by the face, back up by the back face) or
 *   pipes along the pane to it -- "hard to see until light hits them".
 *
 * How far the faces lean, by kind of crack (forensic fractography: radial
 * cracks run through nearly square -- the "3R rule"; concentric cracks
 * lean through the thickness; the Hertzian cone's walls stand 20-40 deg
 * from the surface, i.e. 50-70 deg off square; Hertzian cone,
 * Forensic glass analysis, Wikipedia), each twisted in and out by hackle
 * as it runs, most near the strike.
 *
 * Pure; components/site/BrokenGlass draws it.

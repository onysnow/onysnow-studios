/**
 * What every light in the scene does at a crack (item 10, step 3).
 *
 * A crack is a thin air gap with two new glass faces standing across the
 * pane. Light inside the glass meets a face past the critical angle and is
 * mirrored whole, so a crack flashes where a light, the face and your eye
 * line up; and light piped along the pane escapes at the gap, so a crack
 * glows near a light. That was worked out for the cursor lamp alone. Here it
 * is every light in the list -- the flash, a flare, the flashlight's beam,
 * a neon sign -- each in its own colour, at its own strength against the
 * lamp's, and a beam only where it points (effects/light/beam).
 *
 * Pure: the caller (components/site/BrokenGlass) walks the cracks and draws.

/**
 * The room the glass reflects: an HDR environment, and how a flat pane shows it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * The room reflection was a CSS layer: a graded JPEG of a room, screen-blended
 * over each pane at a set opacity ("Reflection, at rest" / "lit"), zoomed and
 * parallaxed by settings of its own, and switched off entirely under liquid
 * glass. Measured on the page it changed the image by 1-2%, so it could not be
 * seen -- and it could not be made visible and stay physical, because the
 * graded JPEGs had every lamp clipped to white: glass reflects ~4%, and 4% of
 * white is nothing.
 *
 * Now the reflection is worked out from causes in the glass shader, in both
 * glass modes:
 *
 *   what      the room, in real (scene-linear) brightness, lamps included --
 *             log-encoded so that survives an 8-bit JPEG (see ROOM_LMAX)
 *   how much  the glass's reflectance: 4.2% face-on for float glass, rising
 *             toward grazing (the material's index, via Fresnel)
 *   how sharp the front face's roughness. The frosted-float preset is frosted
 *             on the BACK face and polished on the front, as satin glass is,
 *             so its reflection is sharp while what is seen through it is not
 *   where     the reflected ray. The camera looks at the page from
 *             CAMERA_DISTANCE; a point on the pane reflects the direction
 *             (x, y, D) back into the room behind the viewer, so a pane shows
 *             a different part of the room as it scrolls past, and a pane
 *             above eye level shows more ceiling. Mirrored, as mirrors are.
 *
 * Every function here has a GLSL twin in environment.glsl.ts.

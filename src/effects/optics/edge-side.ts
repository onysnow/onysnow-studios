 *

 * is a drawn line: every feature is a reflection, a refraction or a
 * highlight, and every transition is softened over 1-3 px.
 *
 *   arris        the corner between face and side is eased, so it catches
 *                light as a soft band 1-2 px wide -- brightest where the lamp
 *                is, not along the whole edge
 *   side face    a clear window, tinted by the length of glass the light
 *                crossed: saturated teal by the near arris, paler through the
 *                middle, a thin darker line at the far arris
 *   side mirror  it also reflects whatever faces it, so its light and dark
 *                blocks change along its length
 *   glints       short bright segments where the lamp reflects, following it
 *   echo         just inside the edge, a paler displaced copy of it: the side
 *                seen again, by internal reflection, through the face
 *
 * WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE
 *
 * Fixed teal stripes painted in CSS, identical along the whole width of
 * every pane; a 1 px hairline round the pane; a hard echo line 5 px inside;
 * a white glare band the width of the page whenever the lamp was near. Each
 * was a picture of an effect. This file is the causes those effects come
 * from, and every function in it has a GLSL twin in edge-side.glsl.ts.
 *
 * COORDINATES
 *
 * CSS pixels, x right, y down the page, z toward the viewer. The front face
 * of the glass is z = 0, the back face z = -thickness. The lamp and the eye
 * are in front of it (z > 0).

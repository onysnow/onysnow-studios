/**
 * Where the viewer's eye is, and what that does to everything behind the glass.
 *
 * WHY
 *
 * The site looked at the page from one fixed point, straight on. With the
 * photographs a gap behind the glass, that means nothing behind the pane ever
 * moves relative to it: the bend at the edge always sits over the same part of
 * the picture, so you cannot see it bending anything. Real glass is seen from
 * a head that moves, and the picture behind slides under the pane as it does
 * -- through the bevel, which is where you watch it bend.
 *
 * THE MODEL
 *
 * The eye sits CAMERA_DISTANCE viewport widths in front of the screen, and
 * moves with the pointer by the "Viewpoint follows pointer" fraction (0 is a
 * fixed eye, 1 follows the pointer exactly). The glass is the screen plane.
 * A photograph `gap` pixels behind it, seen from an eye moved by e, lands on
 * the glass plane moved by
 *
 *     e * gap / (distance + gap)
 *
 * toward the eye's side -- similar triangles, the same geometry as the cast
 * shadows. Things resting ON the glass (text, buttons, prints) are in the
 * glass plane and do not move. The room reflected in the face shifts too:
 * the reflected ray from a point is (point - eye), so it is read from there.

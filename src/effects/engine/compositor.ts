/**
 * The compositor: every layer a pane has, and their order (optics plan step 4).
 *
 * A pane is a stack. Under what rests on it (the copy, the photographs, the
 * buttons) sit the layers the effects draw into, and their order is optics,
 * not styling: the light under the glass has to be under the light on it; the
 * liquid render has to be under both, or it buries them -- which it did once,
 * when the order lived in scattered z-index rules and a library's inline
 * style won (styles.css, "That is why liquid mode had 'hardly any' edge
 * bloom"). And the layers were inserted by three different pieces of code,
 * each putting its canvas first in the pane, so the DOM order depended on
 * which effect happened to start first.
 *
 * Now the order is this one list, bottom to top, and this module writes each
 * layer's z-index from its place in it and inserts it where it belongs. No
 * effect inserts its own layer; it asks for its slot.
 *
 * The pane's side faces are not in the list: they sit OUTSIDE the pane, above
 * it, because only a sibling can multiply what is behind it (.glass-side).
 * Their z-index is SIDE_LAYER_Z, also written from here.

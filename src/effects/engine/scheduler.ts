/**
 * The scheduler: one animation loop for everything that moves (optics plan
 * step 5).
 *
 * There were eight loops. Each effect ran its own requestAnimationFrame, and
 * three of them never slept: the cursor follower kept easing after it had
 * arrived, the shutter charge kept sampling with nothing held, and the
 * refraction filters re-checked a setting every frame. A tab with a live rAF
 * loop never lets the browser idle its compositor, so a page nobody was
 * touching paid for sixty frames a second -- in battery, on a page that was
 * visually still. The liquid glass library ran a fourth.
 *
 * Now there is one. Work registers as a TASK; a task sleeps until something
 * wakes it, and says after each step whether it still has work. When no task
 * is awake there is no frame at all (e2e/scheduler.spec.ts holds it there).
 *
 * ORDER. Tasks run in a fixed order within a frame, lowest first, so a frame
 * always sees the same sequence: the input moves the lamp, the charge
 * advances, the scene measures, the passes draw, the overlays go last.
 *
 * TIME. Every step gets the frame's time and the time since the last frame
 * it ran in, in milliseconds. Easing is done by time, not by frame, so the
 * page does not move slower when it is busy: see `ease`.

/**
 * One piece of glass, described once (optics plan step 2).
 *
 *   <Pane
 *     material="frosted-float"          what the glass is
 *     thickness={18}                    px
 *     edge={{ width: 40, corner: 0 }}   px: the bevel's real width, the corner's radius
 *     gap={70}                          px between the glass and the photographs behind it
 *     layers={{ smudge: 1, scratch: 1 }} how much of each surface layer it wears
 *   >
 *
 * Every prop is a CAUSE. The bend, the light on the edge, the light through
 * the glass and under it, and the side faces all follow from them, and every
 * pass reads the same description (lib/edge-glow measures it once, from the
 * element's attributes -- effects/materials/pane-causes).
 *
 * Leave a prop out and the pane is today's glass: frosted float, 18 px thick,
 * the "Edge width" and "Glass height" settings, both surface layers in full.
 * So a <Pane> with no props looks exactly as the panes always have.
 *
 * What does not yet read a per-pane value, and reads the page's instead: the
 * light under the glass takes the page's gap (per pane in step 7), and the
 * liquid glass takes the material's index from its own settings.

 * pair, a cause like the gap:
 *
 *   air      separate panes, `gap` px of air between them (0 allowed)
 *   contact  resting on each other, dry
 *   bonded   laminated: the run behaves as one thick pane
 *
 * Everything else follows (effects/scene/graph): each layer's height, the
 * light that reaches it through the ones above, the light through the whole
 * stack onto the photographs, and the stack's reflection.

/**
 * The camera: how the picture is recorded, not what light exists
 * (light-system design, step D).
 *
 * Everything that is the lens or the eye rather than the scene lives here:
 * where the eye is and how far it follows the pointer, the aperture and how
 * it opens with the shutter's charge, the lens's core, ghosts and halo, the
 * glare a bright edge spreads into, and the afterimage the flash leaves. The
 * passes read the camera; none of them reads a camera knob, and a static test
 * (camera.test.ts) holds them to that.
 *
 * The values that come from a knob are getters, so the camera reports exactly
 * what the knob says when read: the same numbers the passes read directly
 * before, which is why nothing on the page changed. The afterimage's knobs
 * reach its CSS through their own custom properties (lib/tuning cssVar), which
 * is the camera's output channel for the stylesheet.

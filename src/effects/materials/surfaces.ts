/**
 * What the things resting on or marking the glass are made of, optically
 * (item 25a). The glass itself is in presets.ts; these are the surfaces:
 * type, the orange plastic, photographic prints, and the two kinds of grime.
 *
 * Only what the light needs is here. Today that is FLUORESCENCE: how much of
 * the ultraviolet a surface absorbs comes back as visible light, and in what
 * colour. Everything glows by this one rule (emitted = UV arriving x yield x
 * colour), so nothing on the page is special-cased for the black light.
 *
 * The numbers are relative, 0 (does not fluoresce) to 1 (fluoresces as
 * brightly as a day-glo pigment, the strongest thing on the page), set from
 * what the sources in claude/tools-research.md say glows and how much:
 *
 *   optical brighteners (in white paper, photo-paper bases, lint and dust)
 *     glow a strong blue-white;
 *   day-glo pigments glow intensely in their own colour;
 *   untreated finger grease and skin oil fluoresce "so weakly it is rarely
 *     useful" (HORIBA) -- forensics dusts prints with fluorescent powder;
 *   ordinary glass, scratches and printing ink barely fluoresce at all.

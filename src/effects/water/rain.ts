/**
 * Rain landing on a window (task 77): how big each drop is when it lands.
 *
 * Log-normal by volume, many small and a few large, as the reference
 * photographs show (water-drops.md 7.4 photos 3, 5: hundreds of tiny drops
 * for every large one). Median 0.45 uL (a contact diameter of about 1.6 mm
 * at 60/40) and a log spread of 0.9 are estimates, set so most drops stick
 * (water runs at 8.7 uL) until merging makes runners. Each rain type
 * (rain-types) has its own median. Capped at 12 uL: anything bigger runs at
 * once (Ony, 2026-10-01: "if the drop gets too big it's gonna drip").

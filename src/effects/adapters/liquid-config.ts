/**
 * The liquid glass adapter (light-system design, step C).
 *
 * The vendored liquid glass library keeps its settings in each pane's
 * `data-config` and watches the attribute, so writing it is enough. What it
 * is given comes from the same places everything else reads: the pane's own
 * causes (its material's frost, its edge width) and the lights. The library's
 * remaining numbers are model constants (the RESULTS in lib/tuning.ts).
 *
 * The library also lights its own gloss and rim, from a fixed light of its
 * own that is not in the list. The only light in the list it could stand for
 * is the room's, so its gloss and rim are scaled by the room's light: with
 * the room dark they are out, and the lamp's own light on the glass is the
 * GlassLight pass above it.
 *
 * Only ever writes when the value would actually change: the library's
 * observer fires on any attribute write, and an identical one is pure work.

# Light catalogue: what the engine models now (2026-09-30)

The current status of Part 3 of `claude/light-physics-reference.md` (the equations and sources are there). Kept up to date as behaviours move from Plan to Preview to Now.

Status: **Now** = modelled today · **Preview** = built behind a `?try=` switch, waiting for Ony · **Plan** = in the design, to build · **Camera** = belongs to the camera stage · **No** = not visible at this scale (reason given).

Updated 2026-09-30 with what the light engine steps E–I and item 32 have built.

# Fireworks (R8)

Research only, 2026-10-01. No code changed. Feeds task 81: photoreal or
photo-derived generative fireworks on the photography site, where every burst
also lights the page through the light list (position, colour, intensity,
decay), and the camera records them the way a real camera would.

Every claim has a source link. **(computed)** marks a number worked out here
from cited formulas (the working is given). **(measured)** marks a number taken
here from a cited, licensed photo or video. **(observed)** marks something seen
in a linked reference photo. **(estimate)** marks a judgement no source states.

Pages that could not be read are listed at the end. The most important gaps
are a measured **star ejection speed** (one 2000 study measured it, but only
the abstract is open) and a **strobe frequency** (none of the open sources
gives one).

## 0. Short answer

- **Build it in our engine, as the tools survey already decided**
  ([tools-survey.md §4](tools-survey.md)). Make the fireworks from physics,
  and record them through a camera model (shutter time, clipping, bloom). Use
  real photos and one real video as **calibration targets**, not as sprites.
  None of the web libraries is physical: fireworks-js uses unitless per-frame
  constants and HSL colours, and tsParticles uses pure `#0000FF` blue (§1).
- **Sizes are known.** The Japan Pyrotechnics Association table gives burst
  height and width for each shell size. A 10-go (30 cm) shell bursts at
  **330 m** and spreads **280 m** wide. A 3-go shell bursts at 120 m and
  spreads 60 m
  ([San-en Fireworks, citing JPA 2009](https://san-en-fireworks.com/index/products/productse/)).
  The US rule of thumb is a burst about **90 ft wide per inch of shell**
  ([Fire Engineering](https://www.fireengineering.com/firefighting/fireworks-and-their-hazards/)).
- **Motion: a fast radial kick, quadratic drag, then a slow sag.** The drag
  model is Zohdi's: drag ∝ v², C_D = 0.5 in the stars' Reynolds range
  ([Zohdi 2016, Proc. R. Soc. A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4786048/)).
  A 10-go burst needs stars leaving at about **150 m/s**. They are down to
  about 50 m/s after 1 s, and settle to a **≈25 m/s** fall **(computed)**. A
  burst stays nearly a sphere while its centre sinks
  ([Yamamoto 1996](https://www2.hamajima.co.jp/~tenjin/labo/hanabi.htm)).
- **Timing.** In one CC BY video, a single burst takes **≈0.5 s to reach
  peak brightness**, then fades to black over **≈1.5 s** **(measured)**.
  Willows "hang in the sky ten seconds or more"
  ([Sky King](https://skykingfireworks.com/safety-school/fireworks-glossary/)).
  Time fuses run **3–6 s** before the burst
  ([Skylighter](https://www.skylighter.com/blogs/fireworks-information/aerial-shell-making-charts)).
- **Colour comes from molecular bands, not hues.** The emitters are SrCl red
  (617–646 nm), BaCl green (511–533 nm), CuCl blue (403–456 nm), Na yellow
  (589 nm) and CaCl orange (591–608 nm)
  ([Wikipedia: Pyrotechnic colorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrotechnic_colorant)).
  Converting these bands with the CIE curves shows two things **(computed)**.
  Blue gives the eye **≈2%** of the brightness that sodium gives for the same
  watts. Barium green lies far **outside sRGB**. That is why blue is "notoriously
  difficult" and green stars clip on camera.
- **On camera, star cores clip to white and keep their colour only at the
  rim and tips** **(observed)**; see the clipping explanation in
  [Wikipedia: Clipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(photography)).
  Streaks come from two things: shutter time × speed, and **real spark
  tails**. The spark tails show even at 1/40 s **(observed)**. Smoke builds up
  and is lit by later bursts
  ([B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/how-to-photograph-fireworks)).
- **Lighting the page.** Each burst is an **emitter** in the existing light
  list (`makeEmitter`/`addEmitter`). It is a big, soft, high light: its
  radius is the burst radius, and its charge follows the measured envelope.
  The list holds **4 lights** and silently drops the rest
  (`light-uniforms.ts:17,125`), so bursts beyond the free slots must be
  **merged**. The page light must not flash more than **3 times a second**
  ([WCAG 2.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold.html)).
  Sound arrives **D/343 s** later
  ([Wikipedia: Speed of sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound)).
- **WebGL1 plan.** Simulate stars on the CPU, with exact drag, in the
  scheduler. Make sparks **stateless on the GPU**: one instanced quad each,
  with its position worked out in closed form in the vertex shader. Instancing
  is on 99.98% of devices
  ([web3dsurvey](https://web3dsurvey.com/webgl/extensions/ANGLE_instanced_arrays)).
  **Correction to the tools survey:** skeeto/webgl-particles does *not* use
  float textures. It packs 16-bit fixed point into RGBA8 bytes and needs only
  vertex texture fetch (§5).

## 1. Tools first

Read from the packages themselves (npm tarballs, `git clone`), 2026-10-01.

| Candidate | Licence | Tech | What it actually does (from source) | Fit | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **fireworks-js** 2.10.8 ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fireworks-js), [repo](https://github.com/crashmax-dev/fireworks-js)) | MIT | Canvas 2D | Explosion particles get a random angle and a speed of 1–10 px/frame (a filled disc, not a shell). Each frame `speed *= friction` (0.95); `y += sin·speed + gravity` (1.5 px/frame, a *constant* fall, not an acceleration); `alpha -= decay` (0.015–0.03/frame, so a life of 33–67 frames). Colour is `hsla(hue 0–360)`. Trails come from a `destination-out` fill at 0.5 opacity plus `lighter` blending (`dist/index.es.js`) | Frame-rate dependent, unitless, no HDR | **Read only.** Its one good idea is the constant fall, which is really a terminal-velocity model and matches §2.3. Nothing else carries over |
| **@tsparticles/preset-fireworks** 4.4.0 ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tsparticles/preset-fireworks)) | MIT | Canvas 2D, engine + 9 plugins | Seven colours `#FF0000 #FF8000 #FFFF00 #00FF00 #00FFFF #0000FF #FF00FF` ±30 S/L.

Each value is a 16-bit fixed-point number split over two bytes (`encode`/`decode`, `BASE = 255`, in `glsl/update.frag`). Gravity, wind and bounce off obstacles; the draw reads the state in the vertex shader. It refuses to run if `MAX_VERTEX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS == 0` (`js/particles.js`) | Works without any float extension. Vertex texture fetch is ≥16 units on 100% of reports, ≥8 in Firefox ([web3dsurvey](https://web3dsurvey.com/webgl/parameters/MAX_VERTEX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS)) | **Port the encode/decode trick** if a stateful GPU tier is ever needed. Probably not needed: see §5.4 |
| Proton, three.quarks, tsParticles engine | MIT | own canvas / three.js | Already surveyed ([tools-survey.md §4](tools-survey.md)) | No | No |

**Decision: build.** Nothing to adopt. Port only the fixed-point trick from

## 2. Firework physics

### 2.1 Shells: sizes, heights, timing

| Japanese size | Mortar (m) | Burst height (m) | Burst width (m) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3-go | 0.09 | 120 | 60 |
| 5-go | 0.15 | 190 | 150 |
| 7-go | 0.21 | 250 | 200 |
| 10-go (shakudama) | 0.30 | 330 | 280 |
| 20-go | 0.60 | 450 | 500 |

Source: [San-en Fireworks](https://san-en-fireworks.com/index/products/productse/),
citing the Japan Pyrotechnics Association (2009, pp. 18–19). Japanese
Wikipedia says a 20-go reaches about 500 m across, and a 40-go about 800 m
([ja: 打上花火](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%89%93%E4%B8%8A%E8%8A%B1%E7%81%AB)).

US rules of thumb ([Fire Engineering](https://www.fireengineering.com/firefighting/fireworks-and-their-hazards/)):

- The lift charge gives "a muzzle velocity of approximately 250 miles per
  hour". That is **112 m/s (computed)**.
- The shell climbs "roughly 120 feet per inch of shell diameter".
- The burst spreads "90 feet in diameter per inch". A 6-inch shell bursts at
  about 700 ft and spreads about 500 ft.
- The time fuse burns "three to six seconds". Skylighter gives 3 s for a
  3-inch shell, 4 s for 5-inch, 5 s for 6-inch and 6 s for 8-inch
  ([charts](https://www.skylighter.com/blogs/fireworks-information/aerial-shell-making-charts)).

Shells are designed to burst at the top of the climb
([FWsim](https://www.fwsim.com/doc/how_fireworks_work.html)). In a
three-break shell, the middle break fires at the apex
([NOVA](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fireworks/anat_nf.html)). Display shells
run from 50 mm to over 600 mm
([Wikipedia: Pyrotechnics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrotechnics)).
Stars start as "half-inch cubes" of composition
([NOVA](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fireworks/anat_nf.html)), which is
about a 7.9 mm-radius sphere of the same volume **(computed: (3/4π)^⅓ × 12.7 mm)**.

### 2.2 Shell types and their recipes

| Type | Definition (source) | Engine recipe **(estimate unless sourced)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Peony** | "Spherical break of colored stars that burn without a tail … relatively plentiful and small stars that travel a relatively short distance … before burning out" ([Wikipedia: Fireworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks)). Stars "burn quickly and the fireworks ball expands in a straight radial direction" ([San-en](https://san-en-fireworks.com/index/products/productse/)) | Many small stars on an even sphere. No spark tail. Short burn (≈2 s, §2.4) |
| **Dahlia** | Like a peony but with "relatively few and large stars that travel a relatively long distance" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks)) | Fewer, bigger stars (lower K, so they fly further). Longer burn |
| **Chrysanthemum** | "Leave a visible trail of sparks" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks)). It "uses comet stars" ([San-en](https://san-en-fireworks.com/index/products/productse/)) | A peony plus charcoal spark tails |
| **Willow / Kamuro** | "Long-burning silver or gold stars that produce a soft, dome-shaped weeping willow-like effect". Kamuro is "dense … glittering … heavy glitter trail" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks)). Willows "have the maximum duration and distance of burning … gradually fall with the force of gravity" ([San-en](https://san-en-fireworks.com/index/products/productse/)). A true willow "hang[s] in the sky ten seconds or more" ([Sky King](https://skykingfireworks.com/safety-school/fireworks-glossary/)) | Charcoal (gold) stars with a **10–12 s** burn and long-lived sparks. The stars reach terminal fall, so the dome droops into vertical strands (§2.3) |
| **Palm** | "Relatively few large comet stars … with a thick rising tail" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks)). A "rising tail … followed by a brocade or willow effect" ([Sky King](https://skykingfireworks.com/safety-school/fireworks-glossary/)) | 6–12 large comets plus a rising tail during the climb |
| **Ring** (Saturn = ring plus peony) | "A circular break of stars that create a ring" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks)); "a peony with a ring around it" ([Sky King](https://skykingfireworks.com/safety-school/fireworks-glossary/)) | Directions on a great circle, with a random tilt, so it is seen as an ellipse |
| **Crossette** | Large stars "travel a short distance before breaking apart into smaller stars" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks)). They "split into four parts" ([FWsim](https://www.fwsim.com/doc/how_fireworks_work.html); [Wikipedia: Pyrotechnics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrotechnics)) | A few comets. At t_split each spawns **4 children** in a cross, perpendicular to its velocity, with a small extra kick |
| **Strobe** | "Colored stars that flash on and off" ([American Pyro](https://www.americanpyro.com/display-fireworks-glossary)); "looks like shimmering water" ([Sky King](https://skykingfireworks.com/safety-school/fireworks-glossary/)). The mechanism is a dark smoulder phase that builds slag, then "a violent … reaction of the slag produces a brilliant flash" (Shimizu, in [Kosanke et al. 2004](#kosanke) §8) | Each star flashes at its **own random phase and rate**. Rate is unsourced, see §7 unknowns. Short flashes |
| **Crackle / dragon eggs** | A star that "first burns for a period … and then loudly deflagrates" ([Wikipedia: Dragon's egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_egg)). It is made with bismuth trioxide and magnalium ([Compound Interest](https://www.compoundchem.com/2015/11/04/fireworksounds/)); the "Crackle Effect … usually accompanied by an aerial gold lace" ([Sky King](https://skykingfireworks.com/safety-school/fireworks-glossary/)) | Gold glitter stars. After a random delay, each pops into a tiny white flash plus a short spray. The sounds are staggered by the delay |
| **Brocade / Horsetail** | Brocade is "a silver tail effect … brighter than the willow" made with glitter ([Sky King](https://skykingfireworks.com/safety-school/fireworks-glossary/)). Horsetail has a "smaller bursting charge … the stars burn for a long time … slowly expands and falls down" ([FWsim](https://www.fwsim.com/doc/how_fireworks_work.html)) | Brocade: willow with silver glitter. Horsetail: low v0 and a long burn |
| **Pistil / heart** | "A ball of stars in the center of another" ([Sky King](https://skykingfireworks.com/safety-school/fireworks-glossary/)). Japanese shells are named by their number of hearts ([San-en](https://san-en-fireworks.com/index/products/productse/)) | A second, smaller sphere (lower v0) in a second colour |
| **Salute** | "Intended to produce a loud report" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks)); "usually accompanied by a bright white flash" ([NOVA](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fireworks/anat_nf.html)) | No stars. One white flash light (≈0.1 s, like `FLASH_DECAY`) plus a sound |
| Colour change | A "dark prime" layer gives "little or no light … between the color changes", and stars change "not … at precisely the same time" (Kosanke §6, [ref](#kosanke)). San-en's "magical peony" stars go dark for a few seconds and then relight ([San-en](https://san-en-fireworks.com/index/products/productse/)) | A colour schedule per star: colour A, then a dark gap, then colour B. Jitter the change time by ±10% per star |

### 2.3 How a star moves

**Model.** Zohdi treats each star as a sphere under gravity and drag
([Zohdi 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4786048/)):

- **m v̇ = −½ ρₐ C_D |v| v A + m g**
- C_D follows Chow's piecewise fit. **C_D = 0.5 for 400 < Re ≤ 3×10⁵**,
  which is the stars' range: Re ≈ 10⁵ at 100 m/s for a 16 mm star
  **(computed: v d / 1.5×10⁻⁵ m²/s)**.
- Zohdi's worked example uses air density 1.225 kg/m³, a 1000 kg/m³ star
  ("porous"), a 3 s time to detonation and a 100 m/s launch.

**Closed forms.**

- Radially, without gravity:
  **r(t) = r₀ + ln(1 + K v₀ t)/K**, with **K = 3 C_D ρₐ / (8 ρ R)**, so
  **v(t) = v₀ / (1 + K v₀ t)** (Zohdi eqs. 2.3, 2.10, 2.11). 1/K is a length
  in metres. Burst size grows with star size and density and shrinks with
  drag.
- Falling under quadratic drag from rest:
  **y = (v∞²/g) ln cosh(g t / v∞)**, with **v∞ = √(g/K)**
  ([Wikipedia: Free fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_fall)).
- With linear drag, every star thrown at the same speed stays on **a sphere
  of radius (V/k)(1 − e^{−kt})**. Its centre falls toward the terminal speed
  g/k. So "the shape of the firework does not break up even with air
  resistance", and the dome of a willow ends in a **cylinder of radius V/k**
  ([Yamamoto 1996](https://www2.hamajima.co.jp/~tenjin/labo/hanabi.htm)).

**Numbers (computed).** C_D = 0.5, ρₐ = 1.225 kg/m³, star density 1000–1500
kg/m³ **(estimate: Zohdi's 1000 is "a neutral option" for porous stars)**:

| Star radius | Density | K (1/m) | 1/K (m) | Terminal fall v∞ (m/s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 mm | 1500 | 0.031 | 33 | 18 |
| 8 mm | 1500 | 0.019 | 52 | 23 |
| 12 mm | 1500 | 0.013 | 78 | 28 |

The ejection speed needed to reach each JPA half-width by burn-out time t_b
(from r = ln(1 + K v₀ t_b)/K) **(computed)**:

| Shell | Half-width | 8 mm stars, t_b 1.5 / 2.5 / 3.5 s | 12 mm stars, t_b 1.5 / 2.5 / 3.5 s |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3-go | 30 m | 27 / 16 / 12 m/s | 24 / 15 / 10 m/s |
| 5-go | 75 m | 112 / 67 / 48 | 84 / 50 / 36 |
| 7-go | 100 m | 201 / 121 / 86 | 135 / 81 / 58 |
| 10-go | 140 m | 473 / 284 / 203 | **260 / 156 / 111** |
| 20-go | 250 m | (unphysical) | 1217 / 730 / 522 |

Bigger shells therefore need **bigger stars**, not only faster ones. A 20-go
needs stars well above 12 mm **(computed)**. Measured star ejection speeds
exist: Takishita et al. recorded "star ejection velocity" for 82 mm Japanese
shells ([OSTI abstract](https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20070595)). Only the
abstract is open, so we have no number from them. **Use v₀ ≈ 150 m/s with
12 mm stars for a 10-go (computed above), and check it against the video in
§4.**

**A full simulation (computed)** of that 10-go star (12 mm, v₀ = 150 m/s,
ODE with quadratic drag and gravity, 1 ms steps):

| t (s) | Horizontal star: x, y (m) | Speed (m/s) | Upward star: height | Downward star: depth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.25 | 31, −0.3 | 101 | 30 | −31 |
| 0.5 | 53, −1.0 | 77 | 52 | −53 |
| 1 | 84, −3.6 | 52 | 81 | −87 |
| 2 | 123, −13 | 33 | 114 | −132 |
| 3 | 148, −27 | 27 | 129 | −168 |
| 5 | 179, −67 | 26 | 128 (falling) | −228 |

What this means visually **(computed)**:

1. The burst reaches **a third of its final size in 0.25 s and 60% in 1 s**.
   It *pops* and then *hangs*.
2. It is an **egg slightly wider at the bottom**: at 2 s it reaches 114 m up
   and 132 m down.
3. After about 3 s, every star falls at about 25–28 m/s. That is the willow
   droop, and the constant fall in fireworks-js.

The closed-form radius matches the full simulation to within 1% at 2 s and
4 s. The ln-cosh sink overestimates the fall by 35–40% (18 vs 13 m at 2 s, 61 vs 45 m at 4 s), because the
horizontal drag also brakes the vertical speed. So **integrate stars
numerically** (§5.4), and keep the closed forms for sparks and tests.

### 2.4 Burn times

| Effect | Burn time | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Time fuse before burst | 3–6 s by shell size | [Fire Engineering](https://www.fireengineering.com/firefighting/fireworks-and-their-hazards/), [Skylighter](https://www.skylighter.com/blogs/fireworks-information/aerial-shell-making-charts) |
| One burst in a Nagaoka starmine, frame-mean brightness | **rise ≈0.5 s, fall to black ≈1.45 s** (first burst: 0.60 → 1.16 → 2.60 s); a mid-show burst rose ≈0.9 s and fell ≈1.2 s | **(measured)** from the CC BY 3.0 [Nagaoka 2015 video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nagaoka_Festival_Fireworks_2015_Extra_Large_Wide_Starmine.webm), 25 fps, mean luma of 107×60 frames. Auto-exposure and compression blur this; the "rise" is mostly the burst growing |
| Willow | ≥10 s | [Sky King](https://skykingfireworks.com/safety-school/fireworks-glossary/) |
| Glitter tail | "several seconds" | [Sky King](https://skykingfireworks.com/safety-school/fireworks-glossary/), [Penguin Pyro](https://penguinpyro.com/pyro-glossary) |
| Falling leaves / dragon eggs | "a few seconds" | [Sky King](https://skykingfireworks.com/safety-school/fireworks-glossary/), [Keystone](https://keystonefireworks.com/news/types-of-fireworks-effects/) |
| Peony star | ≈1.5–2.5 s | **(estimate)** from the measured envelope and the "short distance" definition |
| Comet / chrysanthemum | ≈2.5–4 s | **(estimate)** |
| Rising tail | = the fuse time (3–6 s) | from the sources above |

### 2.5 Trails and sparks

Spark colour follows the metal. Low electronegativity burns hotter, so its
sparks look whiter. Kosanke et al. ([ref](#kosanke), p. 8-10) list spark
colours by element:

| Spark material | Colour |
|---|---|
| Carbon | orange |
| Iron | yellow |
| Aluminium | pale yellow to white |
| Titanium | pale yellow to white |
| Zirconium | white |
| Magnesium | white (but it vaporises, so it makes few sparks) |

Wikipedia adds detail
([Pyrotechnic star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrotechnic_star)):

- Charcoal "makes dim gold sparks".
- Iron makes "gold sparks". Steel makes "branching yellow-orange sparks".
- Coarse titanium makes "branching blue-white sparks".
- Ferrotitanium makes "bright yellow-white sparks".

How long a spark lives:

- For metals, "it is primarily particle size that determines a metal spark's
  duration" (Kosanke p. 8-12).
- Charcoal sparks last long because molten black-powder residue
  (K₂CO₃, K₂S) protects the carbon from burning off too fast (pp. 8-14 to
  8-16).
- "Firefly" sparks change from dim gold to bright silver as aluminium flakes
  ignite (p. 8-18).
- Glitter is a spark with a **delayed flash reaction** (p. 8-38).

So in the engine **(estimate)**:

- A spark is a tiny particle shed by its parent star with a little
  sideways jitter. It has its own drag (very high K, so it stops almost at
  once and then sinks slowly) and a lifetime.
- Its colour is a **blackbody** through the engine's `blackbodyRgb()`:
  charcoal about 1800–2000 K (gold), titanium and aluminium about
  2800–3200 K (white). These temperatures are **estimates** to be fitted to
  the photos.
- A glitter spark is dark for a random delay, then gives one short white
  flash.

### 2.6 Smoke

- Smoke is "tiny [≪0.0001 in.] solid or liquid particles". Flash powder
  smoke is solid Al₂O₃ (Kosanke §9, [ref](#kosanke)).
- "Fireworks leave smoke in the sky … the earliest starbursts are going to
  be the 'cleanest' unless a nice breeze is keeping the smoke moving"
  ([B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/how-to-photograph-fireworks)).
- In the 1/40 s reference photo, dense white puffs sit inside the burst and
  are lit by it **(observed)**: [Kluft, Cameron Park 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kluft-photo-fireworks-Cameron-Park-June-2009-Img_2951c2.jpg).
- In the 30 s photo, a grey haze drifts beside the bursts **(observed)**:
  [Ilotulitus 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ilotulitus_2014_-_panoramio.jpg).

Engine **(estimate)**: each burst leaves a few CC0 smoke-sprite puffs
([flame.md §1](flame.md)) at its centre and along comet paths. They grow,
drift with the wind, and last tens of seconds. They are dark against the
sky until a burst's emitter lights them (§6).

## 3. Colour chemistry

### 3.1 The emitters

| Colour | Emitter | Bands (nm) | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Red | **SrCl** | 617–623, 627–635, 640–646 | Needs a chlorine donor. SrO is "less desirable", so compositions are made oxygen-deficient | [Wikipedia: Pyrotechnic colorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrotechnic_colorant) |
| Red | SrOH | 600–613 | Comes from the binder's hydrogen | same; Kosanke §6 |
| Orange | **CaCl** | 591–599, 603–608 | – | same |
| Yellow | **Na** D-line | 589 | "Very strong, overpowers other colours" | same |
| Green | **BaCl** | 511–515, 524–528, 530–533 | BaOH and BaO add yellow-green. **Ba⁺ emits blue at 455.4 nm**; potassium suppresses it | same |
| Blue | **CuCl** | intense 403–456, weaker 460–530 | CuCl breaks up when hot, giving green-yellow CuOH and orange-red bands. Blue is "notoriously difficult", and "a deep, rich blue is usually viewed as the mark of an experienced fireworks maker" | same |
| White / silver | Al, Mg, Ti incandescence | continuous | Solid particles "emit black-body radiation that causes 'washing out' of the colours" | same |
| Gold | charcoal, iron sparks | continuous (blackbody) | – | §2.5 |

### 3.2 How each looks to the eye and on screen (computed)

Each emitter is taken as flat across its bands (an **estimate**). It is then
integrated through the CIE 1931 multi-lobe fit
([Wyman, Sloan & Shirley 2013, JCGT](https://jcgt.org/published/0002/02/01/))
and converted to linear sRGB with the standard D65 matrix
([Wikipedia: sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB)). Y is per unit
radiant power, with 1.0 = 555 nm.

| Emitter | Y per watt (eye weight) | CIE xy | Linear sRGB, max = 1 | Reading |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Na 589 | 0.78 | 0.567, 0.433 | 1.00, 0.23, **−0.05** | Saturated amber. Clips to orange-yellow |
| CaCl | 0.65 | 0.618, 0.382 | 1.00, 0.08, −0.03 | Red-orange |
| SrOH | 0.55 | 0.652, 0.348 | 1.00, 0.01, −0.02 | Red |
| SrCl | 0.26 | 0.708, 0.292 | 1.00, **−0.08**, −0.01 | Deep red, slightly outside sRGB |
| BaCl | 0.74 | 0.111, 0.804 | **−0.65**, 1.00, −0.05 | Far outside sRGB. Shows as clipped pure green |
| CuCl (403–456 only) | **0.015** | 0.166, 0.011 | 0.13, −0.12, 1.00 | Violet-blue, very dim to the eye |
| Ba⁺ 455.4 | 0.045 | 0.150, 0.021 | 0.04, −0.08, 1.00 | The blue contamination in green |

What follows from the table:

- **Brightness.** For equal radiant output, blue looks **≈50× dimmer than
  green** and red looks **≈3× dimmer than green** **(computed: 0.015 vs 0.74;
  0.26 vs 0.74)**. So a "photoreal" blue burst must be dim or near-white.
  Do not give it the same gain as the others.
- **Gamut.** The engine works in linear RGB. Store each chemistry as its
  **spectral XYZ** and map it to the working space with a gamut clip. Do not
  store hand-picked hexes. The light it *casts* on the page (§6) uses the
  same colour.
- **Absolute brightness.** No open source gives candela for a display star.
  For scale only: SOLAS marine flares must give **15,000 cd for 60 s**
  (hand-held) and **30,000 cd for 40 s** (aerial)
  ([Wikipedia: Flare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare_(pyrotechnic))).
  Their bright red/aluminium compositions were raised by +72%
  ([red tracer study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221491471730034X))
  and +287% ([yellow](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214914716301179))
  in research. Absolute star brightness stays an **unknown**. **Calibrate gain
  by eye** against the photos in §4.4.

### 3.3 How the colours look on camera

- Clipping "may occur in any of the image's color channels separately". The
  clipped area "will typically be completely white". When only one channel
  clips it shows "distorted color"
  ([Wikipedia: Clipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(photography))).
- In the photos, red and green stars have **white cores** and are coloured
  only at their tips and in their dimmer tails **(observed)**:
  [San Diego (PD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Fireworks.jpg)
  and [Portland 10 s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fireworks_PDX_1.jpg).
- In all five reference photos, 0.9–2.3% of the pixels have at least one
  channel clipped, and **0.2–0.5% have all three clipped** **(measured**,
  960 px versions**)**. So clipping is confined to the cores; the frame is
  not washed out.

---

## 4. How cameras record fireworks

### 4.1 Still photography (long exposure)

- The usual settings are ISO 100–200 and f/8 to f/11–16 on Bulb: "open the
  shutter when the shell bursts and then close it when the streaks have
  tapered off". "It is very easy to overexpose"
  ([B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/how-to-photograph-fireworks)).
- A black card over the lens can gather several bursts into one frame (same
  source).
- In a long exposure, "only bright objects leave visible trails"
  ([Wikipedia: Long-exposure photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-exposure_photography)).

Streak length is the distance the star covers while the shutter is open.
With §2.3 speeds, a 10-go star crosses **84 m in its first 1 s** but only
**≈27 m/s × T** late in its life **(computed)**. So a 4 s exposure that
starts at the burst draws long, straight-ish rays that bend into droops at
their tips. That is the chrysanthemum-in-a-photo look.

### 4.2 Video

- At 24 fps a "180° shutter angle is considered normal"; 1/50 s is 173°
  ([Wikipedia: Rotary disc shutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_disc_shutter)).
  A 150 m/s star moves 3 m in 1/50 s **(computed)**, which is a dot or a
  short dash at burst scale.
- **Yet at 1/40 s the Kluft photo still shows streaks** **(observed)**.
  These are real spark tails, not motion blur. Our trails therefore come from
  **two sources**: the spark particles (always there) and the shutter
  integration (camera-dependent).
- A CMOS rolling shutter can catch a flash in only some rows
  ([Wikipedia: Rolling shutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_shutter)).
  This is an optional artefact for salutes and strobes.

### 4.3 Why CG fireworks look fake (estimate, with what each rests on)

1. **Display primaries** (magenta, `#0000FF`, cyan), as in the tsParticles
   preset (§1), instead of band colours with real luminance (§3.2).
2. **No clipping.** Cores should go white and colour should stay at the rims
   (§3.3). Bloom is an artefact of "real-world cameras" in which bright light
   "appears to bleed beyond its natural borders"
   ([Wikipedia: Bloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_(shader_effect))).
   The engine's HDR + bloom stage ([tools-survey.md §10](tools-survey.md))
   does this.
3. **A uniform speed distribution**, as in fireworks-js's 1–10 px/frame,
   fills a disc. Real stars share one v₀, so they make a **shell** (§2.3).
4. **Constant drag or friction per frame**, which depends on the frame rate.
   Real drag is quadratic, so the pop is fast and the hang slow (§2.3).
5. **No sag.** The burst centre should sink at up to v∞ ≈ 25 m/s (§2.3).
6. **Everything ends at once.** Real stars die over a spread of times and
   change colour at different moments (Kosanke §6).
7. **No smoke**, or smoke that is never lit (§2.6), and no light on the
   surroundings: water reflections show in the 30 s and 10 s photos
   **(observed)**.
8. **Wrong timescale.** Space can be scaled to the page, but time must stay
   in real seconds (§7).

## 5. Photo-derived versus generative

### 5.1 Real footage or sprites

Pros: a real look for free. Cons:

- Footage cannot cast light into our list (no positions or colours).
- It is a fixed resolution and fixed timing.
- The licences are not permissive (Pexels, Pixabay and Unsplash, §1).
- A CC0 video of single shells on black was not found.

**Reject as the main approach.** Keep it as an **A/B test**, as flame.md did
for the flame flipbook.

### 5.2 Extracting trails from a photo

Threshold a long-exposure photo, skeletonise it into polylines, and replay
them as star paths **(estimate)**. It gives exact real shapes, but they are
frozen in one pose and one camera. It also cannot reproduce the timing
(when a star was where) from a still. **Reject.** Use photos as *targets*
instead (§7 tests).

### 5.3 Generative from physics plus a camera model

This is **the chosen approach**:

- Physics from §2: SI units with real seconds.
- Colour from §3: spectral XYZ to linear RGB.
- The **camera** from §4: shutter integration, clipping, bloom. The camera
  belongs in `effects/camera/camera.ts`, which "is how the picture is
  recorded, not what light exists".

### 5.4 What ports to raw WebGL1, and the tiering

**Stars (100–300 per shell, a few thousand in a finale, per the tools
survey):**

- Integrate on the CPU in the scheduler with the exact quadratic drag ODE
  (§2.3). Use fixed 1/240 s substeps **(estimate)**; the closed form is used
  only for tests.
- Keep a ring buffer of the last N positions per star (N ≈ 32, **estimate**)
  for the shutter ribbon. Upload it as one dynamic vertex buffer each frame.
- Draw each star as an **additive ribbon** covering [t − shutter, t] into the
  HDR target.

**Sparks (10⁴–10⁵):**

- When a spark is born, the CPU writes its birth position, birth velocity,
  birth time, type and seed into an instance ring buffer.
- The **vertex shader** works out its position in closed form with linear
  drag, p(t) = p₀ + (v₀/k)(1 − e^{−kt}) − (g/k)t + (g/k²)(1 − e^{−kt})
  ([Yamamoto 1996](https://www2.hamajima.co.jp/~tenjin/labo/hanabi.htm)).
  It also works out its age, blackbody colour and glitter flash from the
  seed. No per-frame CPU work is needed.
- This uses `ANGLE_instanced_arrays`, which is on **99.98%** of devices
  ([web3dsurvey](https://web3dsurvey.com/webgl/extensions/ANGLE_instanced_arrays)).
- It needs no float textures and no ping-pong. That is why the skeeto port
  is probably unnecessary. Keep it in reserve for collisions (sparks landing
  on the glass, task 84 dust).

**Smoke:** a few dozen CC0 sprite puffs per burst, drawn before the stars and
lit by the burst emitters (§6).

**Post:** the shared HDR + bloom + tone-map stage
([tools-survey.md §10](tools-survey.md)). Clipping comes from the tone map's
shoulder plus per-channel saturation.

**Rejected:** fireworks-js and tsParticles (Canvas 2D, their own canvas,
unphysical; §1) and three.js-based systems (WebGL2/three, tools survey §4).

---

## 6. How a burst lights its surroundings

### 6.1 Shape of the light over time

- **Burst flash.** A salute is "a bright white flash"
  ([NOVA](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fireworks/anat_nf.html)). Reuse the
  existing flash pulse (`FLASH_DECAY = 0.12 s`, `lights.ts:179`) **(estimate:
  close to a flash-powder report)**.
- **Star light.** In the measured envelope, light grows to a peak in about
  0.5 s and then falls almost linearly to zero over about 1.5 s (§2.4).
  Willows keep a low glow for 10 s and more. Strobes add flicker. Crackle adds
  a burst of sharp pops at the end.
- **Light charge (estimate):**
  charge(t) = Σ over live stars of (intensity × eye weight from §3.2) ÷ the
  peak sum.
  This comes straight from the star simulation, so every shell type gets the
  right envelope with no extra code.

### 6.2 As an entry in our light list

Map each burst to `makeEmitter()` + `addEmitter()`
([lights.ts](../../src/effects/light/lights.ts)):

| Light field | Value **(estimate)** | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `x, y` | The burst centre in the viewport. It sinks with the burst (§2.3) | – |
| `radius` | The burst's current radius in CSS px | An area light the size of the burst gives soft, broad shadows ([shadows.md](shadows.md)) |
| `height` | Large: the sky. Several × the viewport width | A distant source lights the page almost evenly |
| `colour` | The power-weighted mean of the live stars' chemistry colours (§3.2), in true chemistry colour, **not** the clipped white the camera records | The camera clips. The scene light does not |
| `level` / `charge` | The §6.1 envelope × the lab "Burst light" gain | – |

**Slots.**

- `MAX_LIGHTS = 4` (`light-uniforms.ts:17`), and uploads past that are
  dropped (`Math.min(lights.length, MAX_LIGHTS)`, line 125).
- The lamp always takes one slot, and the flash, flare or torch may take
  others (`pointLights()`, `lights.ts:503`).
- So **at most 3 burst lights** **(computed: 4 − the lamp)**.
- When more bursts are alive, **merge** the extras into the nearest burst
  light. Sum their power and use power-weighted position, radius and colour,
  so the page brightness is conserved **(estimate)**.

**Smoke.** Smoke puffs are lit by the same emitters, with a forward-scatter
boost when the burst is behind them **(estimate)**. That gives the "smoke lit
from inside" look of the 1/40 s reference (§2.6).

**Safety.**

- WCAG: "Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three
  times in any one second period". A general flash is a change of
  ≥20 cd/m² where the darker state is below 160 cd/m²
  ([WCAG 2.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold.html)).
- Strobe shells and crackle must therefore **not modulate the page light**
  faster than 3 Hz. Their flicker stays in the star sprites, which are small.
  Rate-limit large changes in page brightness.
- Under `prefers-reduced-motion`, a setting to "minimize the amount of
  non-essential motion"
  ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion)),
  show a still long-exposure frame instead.

### 6.3 Sound delay

- Sound travels at **343 m/s at 20 °C**: 1 km takes 2.92 s
  ([Wikipedia: Speed of sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound)).
- So delay = viewer distance / 343. A 10-go burst (330 m up) seen from 500 m
  away is about **600 m** from the eye, which is **1.7 s (computed:
  √(330² + 500²) / 343)**.
- In the Nagaoka video, sound onsets correlate best with brightness onsets
  at a lag of **≈1.1 s** (r = 0.15–0.30), which is about 380 m away
  **(measured, weak)**.
- Audible media is blocked from autoplay until "the user has interacted with
  the site" ([MDN Autoplay](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Autoplay)).
  So sound is **off by default** and enabled by a click. The PD pdsounds
  recording (§4.4) is the source.

---

## 7. Decisions

### Approach

- **Build** the fireworks in our engine.
  - Physics: CPU stars with quadratic drag, plus closed-form GPU sparks via
    `ANGLE_instanced_arrays` (§5.4).
  - Colour: spectral chemistry (§3.2). Light: emitters in the light list
    (§6.2). Camera: shutter ribbons, clipping and bloom (§4).
- **Port:** nothing now. If a stateful GPU tier is needed, take the RGBA8
  fixed-point state encoding from skeeto/webgl-particles (Unlicense).
- **Adopt** CC0 smoke sprites (Unity Labs `CandleSmoke01`, Kenney) and the
  PD pdsounds audio.
- Photos and video are **calibration targets only**.

### Numbers to use

| Burst height | 120 / 190 / 250 / 330 / 450 m | same |
| Fuse to burst | 3–6 s | [Skylighter](https://www.skylighter.com/blogs/fireworks-information/aerial-shell-making-charts) |
| Lift speed | ≈112 m/s | [Fire Engineering](https://www.fireengineering.com/firefighting/fireworks-and-their-hazards/) |
| Drag | F = ½ρₐC_D A v², C_D = 0.5, ρₐ = 1.225 | [Zohdi 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4786048/) |
| Star radius / density | 8–12 mm / 1000–1500 kg/m³ | **(estimate**, NOVA ½-inch cubes**)** |

| Crossette split | 4 children | [FWsim](https://www.fwsim.com/doc/how_fireworks_work.html) |
| Colours | SrCl, SrOH, CaCl, Na, BaCl, CuCl band tables → XYZ | [Pyrotechnic colorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrotechnic_colorant), [JCGT](https://jcgt.org/published/0002/02/01/) |
| Eye weight per watt | Na 0.78, BaCl 0.74, CaCl 0.65, SrOH 0.55, SrCl 0.26, CuCl 0.015 | **(computed)** |
| Spark colour | charcoal ≈1900 K, Ti/Al ≈3000 K via `blackbodyRgb` | **(estimate)**; colour order from Kosanke |
| Sound | 343 m/s | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound) |
| Page-light flash limit | ≤3 per second | [WCAG 2.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold.html) |
| Burst light slots | ≤3, merge the rest | `light-uniforms.ts:17,125` **(computed)** |

**Scaling to the page (estimate).** Choose **metres per CSS px** so that a
10-go burst spans about 45% of the viewport width. Keep **time real**: g is
9.81 m/s² ÷ (m/px). Space can be scaled, but the eye judges the timing.

### Lab controls

- **Shell:** type (peony, dahlia, chrysanthemum, willow/kamuro, palm, ring,
  Saturn, crossette, strobe, crackle, brocade, horsetail, pistil, salute) and
  size (3–20 go).
- **Stars:** count, radius, density, burn time, burn-time spread, colour 1
  and 2 (by chemistry), change time, dark-prime gap.
- **Sparks:** type (charcoal, iron, titanium, glitter, firefly), rate, life,
  temperature.
- **Specials:** crossette split time; strobe rate and duty; crackle delay
  range; rising tail on/off.
- **Sky:** metres per px, wind, smoke amount, smoke life, launch cadence and
  finale.
- **Camera:** shutter time (1/50 s video up to 30 s Bulb), black-card
  multi-burst, exposure, clip knee, and bloom (from the shared stage).
- **Light:** burst light gain, height, max burst lights (1–3), merge on/off,
  flash limiter on/off (on by default).
- **Sound:** on/off, viewer distance (sets the delay).

### Tests

**Unit tests**

- Closed-form radius r(t) = ln(1 + Kv₀t)/K matches the ODE to within 2%
  (gravity off).
- The burst half-width at burn-out is within ±15% of the JPA table for each
  shell size.
- Terminal speed is √(g/K).
- Crossette children conserve the parent's momentum.
- The chemistry colours keep their hue order. Na: r > g > b. BaCl: g is
  dominant. CuCl: b is dominant. Each has the eye weights above.
- The emitter merge conserves total power.
- The page-light flash counter never exceeds 3 transitions per second for
  strobe and crackle shells.
- Sound delay = distance/343.
- Reduced motion shows a still frame.
- The time step is frame-rate independent: the result at 30 fps matches
  the result at 144 fps.

**Visual tests, side by side in the lab**

| Lab shutter | Reference |
|---|---|
| 1/40 s | Kluft Cameron Park |
| 2.7 s | Düsseldorf |
| 10 s | Portland |
| 30 s | Ilotulitus |

Match the share of fully clipped pixels (0.2–0.5%, §3.3) and the coloured
rims.

**Envelope test.** Compute the frame-mean brightness of a lab peony with
the same method as §2.4: rise 0.5–0.9 s, fall 1.2–1.5 s.

**Performance.** Three 10-go shells at once (≈900 stars, ≈20k sparks) take
**under 2 ms CPU and under 3 ms GPU** on a mid-range phone (**estimate,
target**).

### Still unknown

1. **Measured star ejection speeds.** The Takishita et al. 2000 numbers are
   paywalled. §2.3 derives them from burst sizes instead.
2. **The strobe rate (Hz)** of real strobe stars. Corbel et al. 2013
   (Angewandte Chemie) and the J. Pyrotechnics strobe paper describe the
   mechanism but give no open number. Until measured from a licensed video,
   it is a lab control.
3. **Absolute star intensity (cd).** Calibrate by eye (§3.2).
4. **The real peony burn time** in a single-shell video. Our only
